        <p>
          I am an explorer and a lifelong learner, never content to wait for an opportunity to fall into my lap. I seek out greatness in my life and will continue to push myself even farther than where I have already gone, and live it in both my work
          life and recreational life. I’ve worked in IT for 15 years, and in that time I’ve fixed and repaired computers, provided tier II technical support, performed functionality testing on video games, utilized SQL queries to build reports and
          repair access databases, developed programs in Python to work on parsing through XML, emails, and JSON data, and trained lawyers and paralegals on how to use relational database software to build their cases.
          <br><br>
          And I have no intention to rest on my laurels. I am constantly taking classes to learn new technology and acquire new skills in things such as Javascript, Python, AWS, and SQL development. I'm unrelenting in solving problems and strive to
          solve a client’s problem so long as it's within my realm to solve and avoid passing off issues to escalation teams when I can.
          <br><br>
          I’m locate in Denver, Colorado and would like to join a horizontally structured company. I thrive in environments where I always have something to do and especially something new to learn as I'm passionate about self-improvement.
