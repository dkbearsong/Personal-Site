          <h3>Brewing Beer</h3>
          <p>In 2011, a friend of mine was gifted a homebrewing kit. Haven recently gotten into craft beer the year before, I took a keen interest into the idea of making beer myself. Thus began a journey that has included many
           a long days of mashing, boiling, transfering, cleaning, kegging, and sweating as well as plenty of investment in equipment, failed batches, learning new processes and techniques, experimentaiton, and ultimately the most
           satisfying batch of ale that you've ever drank: your own. Many a story have been told over a good pint, and many more will be shared for decades to come!</p>

          Judo, Sil Lum Kung Fu, Arnis, Wing Chun, Western Boxing, Wrestling, and Muay Thai, as well as analyzed various other styles and tried to incorporate them in my training. I aim to get back more heavily into practicing again one day and make it a
           major part of my life once more </p>
